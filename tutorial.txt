My name is Justin Muhlbaier, im 18 and im from Jupiter Florida. 
I went to The Benjamin School for lower, middle and highschool and that is where I utimately graduated from.
In my free time I tend to enjoy reading, videogames and various forms of art. 
Art such as writing, digital drawing, paper drawing, and world building.
I enjoy DND, and I tend to listen to music while doing pretty much anything that doesnt require my ears.
